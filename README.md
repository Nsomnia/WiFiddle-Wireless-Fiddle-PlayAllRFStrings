# Zsh Penetration Testing Toolkit

Welcome to the Zsh Penetration Testing Toolkit! This toolkit provides a streamlined, Zsh and Curses-based interface to manage and launch a collection of common penetration testing scripts and tools. It's designed for pentesters and security enthusiasts who prefer a command-line environment but appreciate a structured, menu-driven approach to accessing their arsenal.

Our goal is to simplify the execution of various tools by providing wrapper scripts that handle common configurations and logging, all accessible through an intuitive curses interface.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
    cd zsh-pentest-toolkit
    ```
2.  **Ensure Zsh is installed:** Most modern Linux distributions and macOS systems come with Zsh. If not, you can typically install it via your system's package manager.
    *   For Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install zsh`
    *   For Fedora: `sudo dnf install zsh`
    *   For macOS (if not default): `brew install zsh`
3.  **Zsh Curses Module (`zsh/curses`):** This module is a standard part of Zsh and should be available with your installation. The toolkit script (`pen_test_toolkit.zsh`) will attempt to load it automatically using `zmodload zsh/curses`. If you encounter issues, ensure your Zsh installation is complete and not a minimal version.

### Important: `zsh/curses` Module Prerequisites

This toolkit relies heavily on the `zsh/curses` module for its user interface. 
For the toolkit to function correctly, your Zsh environment must meet the following conditions:

1.  **`zsh/curses` Module Availability:** The `zmodload zsh/curses` command must successfully load the module.
2.  **Standard Curses Functions:** The loaded `zsh/curses` module must provide standard curses function names, such as:
    *   `zcurses_init`
    *   `zcurses_end`
    *   `zcurses_newwin`
    *   `zcurses_addstr`
    *   `zcurses_refresh`
    *   `zcurses_clear`
    *   `zcurses_box`
    *   `zcurses_attr` (or `zcurses_attr_on`/`zcurses_attr_off`)
    *   `zcurses_readkey`
    *   `zcurses_getmaxyx`
    *   `zcurses_delwin`
    *   `zcurses_messagebox` (if available, or similar functionality)
    *   Color functions like `zcurses_start_color`, `zcurses_init_pair` (if color features are desired).

If you encounter errors like "zcurses_init: command not found" or similar, it likely means your Zsh's `curses` module is missing, incomplete, or uses different function names. Please ensure your Zsh installation includes a fully functional `curses` module that adheres to these common function names. This might involve recompiling Zsh with appropriate options or installing an alternative `zsh-curses` package if your distribution provides one.

4.  **Install Penetration Testing Tools:** The individual tools wrapped by this toolkit need to be installed separately on your system. The wrapper scripts within the toolkit are designed to notify you if a specific tool is missing. Common installation commands for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems are:
    *   `btscanner`: `sudo apt install btscanner`
    *   `bluez` (for `bluetoothctl`): `sudo apt install bluez`
    *   `aircrack-ng` suite (for `airodump-ng`, `aireplay-ng`): `sudo apt install aircrack-ng`
    *   `nmap`: `sudo apt install nmap`
    Refer to your distribution's documentation for installing these tools on other systems.
5.  **Make the main script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x pen_test_toolkit.zsh
    ```
6.  **(Optional) Review individual wrapper scripts:** The tool wrapper scripts are located in the `tools/` directory (e.g., `tools/bluetooth/run_btscanner.sh`). You may want to review them to understand their specific operations or if you need to modify them for advanced use cases. Ensure they are also executable (`chmod +x tools/*/*.sh`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Run the main toolkit script** from the root directory of the project:
    ```bash
    ./pen_test_toolkit.zsh
    ```
2.  **Navigate the menu:**
    *   Use the **UP** and **DOWN arrow keys** to highlight different tools or options.
    *   Press **ENTER** to select a highlighted tool/option. This will either launch the tool's wrapper script or take you to a submenu (future feature).
3.  **Exiting:**
    *   Press **'q'** to quit the current menu or, if at the main menu, to exit the toolkit.
    *   The "Exit Toolkit" option in the main menu will also close the application.
4.  **Tool Interaction:** Once a tool is selected, its wrapper script will take over. This might involve:
    *   The Zsh/Curses interface closing temporarily to run the tool in the standard terminal.
    *   Prompts for further information (e.g., network interface, target IP).
    *   Follow the on-screen instructions provided by each wrapper script.
5.  **Logging:** All significant actions, tool executions, and errors are logged in `toolkit.log` in the root directory of the toolkit. This file can be useful for tracking your activities or debugging issues.
